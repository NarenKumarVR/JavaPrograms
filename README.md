1. How Many X's?

Given an integer X within the range of 0 to 9, and given two positive integers as upper and lower bounds respectively, find the number of times X occurs as a digit in an integer within the range, excluding the bounds. Print the frequency of occurrence as output.

Note : Save the file / class as “countXInRange” with appropriate file extension.  

Input:
The first line of input is an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, there are two lines of input, first consisting of the integer X, whose occurrence has to be counted. Second, the lower and upper bound, L and U which are positive integers, on the same line separated by a single space, respectively.

Output:
For each test case, there is only one line of output, the count of the occurrence of X as a digit in the numbers lying between the lower and upper bound, excluding them.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
0<=X<=9
0<L<U<=10^5

Example:
Input:
2
3
100 250
0
20 21
Output:
35
0

Explanation:
In the first test case, the occurrence of 3 in the numbers starting from 101 to 249 is counted and comes out to be 35.
Similarly, for all the other test cases, the occurrence of the given number X is printed as output.

Input:

9. Lily has a chocolate bar that she wants to share it with Ron for his birthday. Each of the squares has an integer on it. She decides to share a contiguous segment of the bar selected such that the length of the segment matches Ron's birth month and the sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birth day. You must determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.
Consider the chocolate bar as an array of squares, .s = [2,2,1,3.2]. She wants to find segments summing to Ron's birth day, d= 4  with a length equalling his birth month, m=2 . In this case, there are two segments meeting her criteria: [2,2] and .[1,3]
Function Description
Complete the birthday function in the editor below. It should return an integer denoting the number of ways Lily can divide the chocolate bar.
birthday has the following parameter(s):

10. You have been asked to help study the population of birds migrating across the continent. Each type of bird you are interested in will be identified by an integer value. Each time a particular kind of bird is spotted, its id number will be added to your array of sightings. You would like to be able to find out which type of bird is most common given a list of sightings. Your task is to print the type number of that bird and if two or more types of birds are equally common, choose the type with the smallest ID number.
For example, assume your bird sightings are of types .arr = [ 1, 1, 2, 3, 3 ] There are two each of types  1 and 2, and one sighting of type 3 . Pick the lower of the two types seen twice: type 1.
Function Description
Complete the migratoryBirds function in the editor below. It should return the lowest type number of the most frequently sighted bird.
migratoryBirds has the following parameter(s):
●	arr: an array of integers representing types of birds sighted
Input Format
The first line contains an integer denoting , the number of birds sighted and reported in the array . 
The second line describes  as  space-separated integers representing the type numbers of each bird sighted.
Constraint : 
It is guaranteed that each type is 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5
Sample Input 1 :
6
1 4 4 4 5 3

Sample Output:
4

The different types of birds occur in the following frequencies:
●	Type 1:  1 bird
●	Type 2: 0 birds
●	Type 3:  1 bird
●	Type 4: 3 birds
●	Type 5: 1 bird
The type number that occurs at the highest frequency is type 4, so we print 4 as our answer.

Sample Input 2 :
11
1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 3 4

Sample Output:
3

The different types of birds occur in the following frequencies:
●	Type 1:  2 birds
●	Type 2: 2 birds
●	Type 3:  3 birds
●	Type 4:  3 birds
●	Type 5: 1 bird
The type number that occurs at the highest frequency is type 3 and type 4, so we print 3 as our answer.
